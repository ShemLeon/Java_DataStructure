## Overview

This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms in Java. It serves as both a learning resource and a reference for common computer science concepts.

## Data Structures

The repository includes the following data structures:

## Overview

### 3. Recursion (_3_Recursia)
- Various recursive algorithm implementations

### 4. Stack (_4_Mahsanit)
- LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) data structure implementation
- Stack operations (push, pop, peek)
- Applications of stacks

### 5. Queue (_5_Queue)
- FIFO (First-In-First-Out) data structure implementation
- Queue operations (enqueue, dequeue)
- Applications of queues

### 6. Linked List (_6_Reshima_Mekusheret)
- Singly linked list implementation
- List operations (insert, delete, traverse)
- Applications of linked lists

### 7. Binary Tree (_7_BinNode)
- Binary tree implementation
- Tree traversal algorithms
- Applications of binary trees

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Any Java IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, etc.)

### Running the Examples
1. Clone this repository
2. Open the project in your favorite Java IDE
3. Navigate to the specific data structure or algorithm you want to explore
4. Run the main method in the respective class

## Usage Examples

```java
// Example of using search algorithms
int[] arr = {-5, -4, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9};
boolean found = Sorting.linear_search(arr, 5);  // true
int index = Sorting.binary_search(arr, 5);      // returns index of element 5
```
